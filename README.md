# InvoicePlane Income/Expense Report

## Introduction

This report collects all invoices and expenses in a timespan and sorts them by date.

## Requirements

* [InvoicePlane](https://invoiceplane.com) (>=2.0.0-alpha.1)

## Usage

Download the repository into the custom/addons directory of your InvoicePlane setup and go to the Addons-Panel to install the addon. Afterwards, find the Report using Reports/Invoice Expense Report.

## Expense References

InvoicePlane currently has no reference field for expenses to document supplier invoice numbers, so I used the first custom field of the expenses table. (Use the Custom Fields feature to add one).
